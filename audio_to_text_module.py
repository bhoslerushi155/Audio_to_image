"""
Each Recognizer instance has seven methods for recognizing speech from an audio source using various APIs. These are:

recognize_bing(): Microsoft Bing Speech
recognize_google(): Google Web Speech API
recognize_google_cloud(): Google Cloud Speech - requires installation of the google-cloud-speech package
recognize_houndify(): Houndify by SoundHound
recognize_ibm(): IBM Speech to Text
recognize_sphinx(): CMU Sphinx - requires installing PocketSphinx
recognize_wit(): Wit.ai
Of the seven, only recognize_sphinx() works offline with the CMU Sphinx engine. The other six all require an internet connection.

A full discussion of the features and benefits of each API is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Since SpeechRecognition ships with a default API key for the Google Web Speech API, you can get started with it right away. For this reason, weâ€™ll use the Web Speech API in this guide. The other six APIs all require authentication with either an API key or a username/password combination. For more information, consult the SpeechRecognition
